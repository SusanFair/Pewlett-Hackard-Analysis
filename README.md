# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
# Silver Tsunami Mitigation Analysis
As wIth any large company blessed with longevity in the industry Pewlett-Hackard will soon be expiencing a once in a lifetime event.  Baby Boomers are quickly approaching retirement age.  As the name suggests this represents a large portion of the population retiring within a short period of time.

As a good corporate citizen PH is offering  a retirement package. That's good however PH must also think about maintaining continuity when these packages are accepted and various roles within the company as left vacant in their wake.

## Overview of the analysis: 
This analysis is a proactive review of the impacts of this silver tsunami or retirements.  We looked at the retiring population from two perspectives:
  * Who, what roles wil be impacts?
  * How many positions will need to be filled?

Arming Human Resources with this information will allow them to start job searches, recruiting and mentoring in advance.

### Stepping in with big data
To facilitate this analysis current records will be uploaded into a newly design SQL database to facilitate more effecient data mining, retrieval and presentation.

## Results:

 The results give a clear picture of who will be retiring and what opportunities does HR have to mitigate the impact from within. 

*  **Number of retiring staff by Title - Cause for Concern**
This analysis provided results on employees born between 1952 and 1955 returning their names and most recent/current job titles.

The results here show something alarming.  The highest volume of those close to retirement are our Senior Engineers.  This is followed closely by Senior staff in general.  Finding the right people for these roles will be pivotol to the companies continued success

* **Number of retire staff by Title - Silver Lining**
Conversly where the rubber hits the road there are siginificantly fewer staff in these roles approaching retirement age.  Assistant Engineers and Managers represent the fewest number of employees which means that stability at the working level will remain consistent through the retirement tsunami transition.

* **Secure the Future Through Mentorship - Another Silver Lining**
With so many Senior Staff members retiring the future direction of the company is at stake.  HR has good resources to work with though.  The analysis shows that those who have a good amount of experience and yet are at least 10 years away from retirement are the represent over 500 staff members.  This is certainly something to work with.  

* **Secure the Technical Future**
Assistent Engineers numbers are high in the 10+ years from retirement age.  A mentorship camptain in the engineering community to share information between the Senior Engineers and the Assistant Engineer will allow the Assistant Engineers to be ready to step up to Senior Engineers in fill the vacant roles when the time comes.  All of this without loosing technical continuity.  A key for success in a company like Pewlett-Hackard.
